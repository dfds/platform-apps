| Policy Name                    | Category              | Description                                                                                   | Why                                                                                      | Folder      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| disallow-host-path             | Pod Security Standards| Disallow hostPath volumes to prevent pods from accessing the host filesystem.                 | Prevents privilege escalation and access to sensitive host data.                         | baseline    |
| disallow-privilege-escalation  | Pod Security Standards| Disallow privilege escalation by requiring allowPrivilegeEscalation to be false.              | Stops containers from gaining more privileges than intended.                             | baseline    |
| disallow-privileged-containers | Pod Security Standards| Disallow privileged containers by ensuring privileged is false or undefined.                  | Prevents disabling of security mechanisms in containers.                                 | baseline    |
| restrict-capabilities          | Pod Security Standards| Require all Linux capabilities to be dropped except NET_BIND_SERVICE if needed.               | Minimizes container permissions to reduce attack surface.                                | baseline    |
| require-resources              | Best Practices        | Require CPU requests (no limits) and equal memory requests/limits for all containers.         | Ensures fair resource allocation and prevents resource exhaustion.                       | operational |
| require-run-as-nonroot         | Pod Security Standards| Require containers to run as non-root users (runAsNonRoot: true).                             | Prevents running containers as root, reducing risk of privilege escalation.              | restricted  |
