                  You can specify one or two addresses. Do not include the /32 suffix.
                  If you bring your own IP address pool to Global Accelerator (BYOIP), you can choose an IPv4 address from your own pool to use for the accelerator's static IPv4 address.
                  After you bring an address range to AWS, it appears in your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it.
                  Global Accelerator assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to AWS, you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator.
                  Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator. To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses.
                  For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

                        ClientAffinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port and protocol of the client request.
                        Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.
                        AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection.
                        If client affinity is NONE, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint.
                        However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.
                        If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead.
                        When you use the SOURCE_IP setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.
                        The default value is NONE.

                                    If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                                    For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint,
                                    5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint.
